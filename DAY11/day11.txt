Day 11 – Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

Identified and learned about attaching a network interface using Elastic Network Interfaces.

Elastic Network Interfaces provide flexible networking by allowing additional network interfaces to be attached or detached from EC2 instances without stopping the instance.

Each ENI:
- Belongs to one VPC and one subnet
- Has a primary private IPv4 address
- Can have secondary private IP addresses
- Can optionally have an Elastic IP associated

An ENI can be:
- Detached from one EC2 instance
- Attached to another EC2 instance within the same Availability Zone

Key Point:
The Elastic Network Interface must be created in the same subnet and Availability Zone as the EC2 instance it is attached to.
